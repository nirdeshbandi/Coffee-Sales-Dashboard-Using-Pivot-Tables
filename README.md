# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard-Using-Pivot-Tables
The coffee sales dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to provide insights into various aspects of coffee sales performance over time. It consolidates data from multiple sources to help coffee shops make informed business decisions.
Using the data from the sheets,i have created the pivot tables to summarize and analyze the information effectively:
Sales by Coffee Type: A Pivot Table can be configured to show total sales for each coffee type (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta) across different months or years. This helps identify which types are most popular and profitable.
Monthly Trends: By organizing data by month and year, users can visualize trends in coffee sales over time. This can be represented in a line chart or bar graph for easy interpretation.
I have only used the pivot tables to make the coffee sales dashboard with simple and interactive in order to find the coffee sales over years and some sspecific date and time.
